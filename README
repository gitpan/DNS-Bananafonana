==============================
DNS::Bananafonana Version 0.1
==============================

This module handles numbers in base 85, via strings and Math::BigInt.
Instead of the 85 characters as defined rfc1924, this modules uses 85
consonant-vowel combination that will make the result pronouncable by human
beings. This scheme was suggested in a comment by DGolden on Slashdot
(http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=649579&cid=24654733).

For more information, read the module or rfc1924.txt.

The usual installation instructions apply:

	/path/to/perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
